## About


This repository shares three files we used to conduct the study. The missing_data.R file has the R code we used to run the **Little's MCAT test** and **multiple imputation** to compare regression results from the original dataset and the multiple imputed datasets. The causal_inference_analyses dofile has the Stata code we used to run all the main analysis including the **propensity score matching and weighting analyses**. The USA_causal.dta has the **US data** from the PISA 2018 student questionnaire data which was used for the analysis.
